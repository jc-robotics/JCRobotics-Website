        About Us
    </h1>

    <p>Many years ago, Jamaica College registered a team that wanted to do Robotics. The JC Pirates went to the 1994 First Competition (now known as FRC or First Robotics Competition) and was the first international team to compete in a competition held by First. Their creativity and passion for it led them to compete well in that competition.</p>

    <p>With this passion in mind, the Jamaica College Robotics Club was born in 2009. This club was created as a space to inspire creativity in the boys and give them all the tools and knowledge they would need to create machines that can make a difference.</p>
